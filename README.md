This is a learning STM32 bare metal C project for me. I want to build an anchor warner for boating. The Nucleo F411, board should continously read a GPS (LB86) and display the offset between a given point (anchor) and the actual position. I started by implementing a TFT display with SPI using DMA and took the time to make a simple GFX library to display Chars (upper case only), Numbers, Boxes and Circles. Next step will be to get the USART1 controller to talk to the GPS receiver to determine the position. As a last step I want to add touch screen support or external buttons to be able to set the anchor position and actual position. Additional features would be a postion history stored in permanent memory as well as a tiny speaker to have an accoustic alarm.
